# Predicting_GDP per capita

**Goal of Project**

The goal of this project is to understand the dataset, get some insights about it and finally train a model to predict GDP ($ per capita).

**About the dataset**

We will be using the Countries of the World dataset from kaggle (link:https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world)

20 columns of dataset:
* Country
* Region
* Population
* Area
* Pop. Density (per sq. mi.)
* Coastline (coast/area ratio)
* Net migration
* Infant mortality (per 1000 births)	
* GDP ($ per capita)	
* Literacy (%)	
* Phones (per 1000)	
* Arable (%)	
* Crops (%)	
* Other (%)	
* Climate	
* Birthrate	
* Deathrate	
* Agriculture	
* Industry	
* Service

**Interesting EDA on dataset**

The below join plot graph not only shows the linear relationship between GDP per Capita, but it also shows the concentrations that countries belong in on the graph. There is a very high number of countries that have a very long GDP per Capita and also a very long literacy rate. This highlights the importance of literacy rates in increasing the GDP per Capita of a country.
